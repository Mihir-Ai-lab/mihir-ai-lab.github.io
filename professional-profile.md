Over the last few years, I’ve been focused on building **Ostrich AI** — a modular infrastructure stack purpose-built to simplify the secure, scalable deployment of AI.

From product architecture to compliance frameworks and GTM strategy, I’ve led initiatives to ensure Ostrich AI meets the demands of modern enterprises — especially those navigating data sovereignty, talent bottlenecks, and rising compute costs.

### 🧠 What We’ve Engineered
---

The Ostrich AI ecosystem is designed to solve three hard problems in enterprise AI:

🔐 **Secure data** — Privacy-first infra (DPDP / GDPR ready)<br>  
🤝 **Scalable talent** — Crowdsourced AI builds via datathons<br>  
⚡ **Affordable compute** — GPU sharing across decentralized networks<br>  

This isn’t theory — it’s engineered for production environments where **compliance is critical**, **cloud spend is painful**, and **talent needs activation**, not just hiring.

---

Each of the core modules — **VaultNet**, **Data Burrough**, and **GPU Pradhan** — reflects a larger belief: AI infrastructure should be **sovereign by design**, not vendor-locked.

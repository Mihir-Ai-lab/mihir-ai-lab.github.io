## Highlights from My Ongoing Work
---

These are some of the platforms, initiatives, and ideas I’ve built (or am currently building) — each shaped by a belief in sovereign-by-design systems and practical, real-world AI.

---

### 🧠 Ostrich  
A plug-and-play AI studio to build, tune, and deploy ML models across private or remote infrastructure.  
Built to reduce time-to-deploy while enforcing privacy, cost-efficiency, and IP control.

---

### 🔐 VaultNet  
My granted Indian patent (No. 567234) led to this — a blockchain-based orchestration layer that secures AI workflows using a dual-key escrow system.  
It ensures models and data interact securely, with full auditability and IP protection baked in.

---

### 🌍 Data Burrough  
A curated community of AI engineers and enthusiasts, solving real-world challenges through datathons and collaborative builds.  
Started as an internal talent engine — now open to individuals and organizations seeking hands-on AI.

### ⚡ GPU Pradhan  
As India’s appointed delegate to **GAFAI**, I’ve been working on democratizing access to compute.  
GPU Pradhan is a decentralized initiative to unlock idle GPU power — making it accessible, affordable, and sovereign-ready.

More in the pipeline — but these are the ones I’m actively scaling today.

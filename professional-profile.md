Much of my recent work has gone into shaping **Ostrich AI** — a modular, privacy-first infrastructure that simplifies secure deployment of AI systems.

This ecosystem is supported by three key pillars my team and I have crafted from the ground up:

### 🔐 VaultNet  
---

A patented orchestration layer that uses dual-key blockchain escrow to protect data and model IP — while ensuring full traceability and compliance.  
→ [Explore VaultNet](/work/blockchain-escrow/)

### 🌍 Data Burrough  
---

A handpicked community of AI engineers solving real-world problems through datathons and collaborative builds.  
→ [Join the Community](https://nas.io/ostrich-ai)

### ⚡ GPU Pradhan  
---

A decentralized initiative aligned with my **GAFAI delegate** mandate to make compute affordable, sovereign, and accessible across India.

Each of these is a building block — together, they make up the Ostrich AI ecosystem.

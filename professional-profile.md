Over the past few years, my focus has been building **Ostrich AI** — a modular infrastructure stack designed to simplify secure, scalable AI deployment.

As a systems-builder, I’ve led the product direction, compliance architecture, and go-to-market initiatives, ensuring Ostrich AI aligns with modern enterprise needs.

### 🧠 What We’ve Built
---

The Ostrich AI ecosystem addresses three persistent blockers in enterprise AI adoption:

🔐 **Secure data** — Privacy-first infra that’s DPDP/GDPR ready<br>  
⚡ **Affordable compute** — GPU sharing across decentralized networks<br>  
🤝 **Scalable talent** — Crowdsourced AI engineering via datathons<br>

We engineered this ecosystem to work in the real world — where compliance is non-negotiable, cloud bills hurt, and building talent pipelines takes more than job posts.

Each pillar (VaultNet, Data Burrough, GPU Pradhan) reflects a belief: AI infra should be **sovereign by design**, not held hostage by platforms.

This page is a snapshot of that vision turned into action.

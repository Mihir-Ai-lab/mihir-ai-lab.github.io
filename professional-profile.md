Much of my recent work has gone into shaping **Ostrich AI** — a modular, privacy-first infrastructure that simplifies secure deployment of AI systems.

This ecosystem is supported by three key pillars my team and I have crafted from the ground up:

### 🔐 VaultNet  
---

A patented orchestration layer that uses dual-key blockchain escrow to protect data and model IP — while ensuring full traceability and compliance.  
→ [Explore VaultNet](/work/blockchain-escrow/)

### 🌍 Data Burrough  
---

A handpicked community of AI engineers solving real-world problems through datathons and collaborative builds.  
→ [Join the Community](https://nas.io/ostrich-ai)

### ⚡ GPU Pradhan  
---

A decentralized initiative aligned with my **GAFAI delegate** mandate to make compute affordable, sovereign, and accessible across India.

---

Each of these is a building block — together, they make up the Ostrich AI ecosystem.

Over the past few years, my focus has been building **Ostrich AI** — a modular infrastructure stack designed to simplify secure, scalable AI deployment.

As a systems-builder, I’ve led the product direction, compliance architecture, and go-to-market initiatives, ensuring Ostrich AI aligns with modern enterprise needs.

### 🧠 What We’ve Built
---

The Ostrich AI ecosystem addresses three persistent blockers in enterprise AI adoption:

🔐 **Secure data** — Privacy-first infra that’s DPDP/GDPR ready  
⚡ **Affordable compute** — GPU sharing across decentralized networks  
🤝 **Scalable talent** — Crowdsourced AI engineering via datathons

We engineered this ecosystem to work in the real world — where compliance is non-negotiable, cloud bills hurt, and building talent pipelines takes more than job posts.

---

Each pillar (VaultNet, Data Burrough, GPU Pradhan) reflects a belief: AI infra should be **sovereign by design**, not held hostage by platforms.

This page is a snapshot of that vision turned into action.

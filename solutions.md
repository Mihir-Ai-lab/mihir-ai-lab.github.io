## The Bottleneck Triad

| Pain | Why It Hurts |
|---|---|
| **Privacy Walls** | DPDP / GDPR / HIPAA block external talent |
| **GPU Scarcity** | Centralised infra inflates cost 3-5Ã— |
| **Talent Gap** | $200 k TCO per ML hire; reproducibility still shaky |

## Our Stack

| Pillar | What It Does | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **Dual-Key Privacy** | Data-owner Key A + Model-owner Key B, logged on-chain | Share PII-grade data without leaks |
| **Remote GPU Marketplace** | Crowdsources idle GPUs, latency-optimised | **â‰¤ 60 %** cheaper than hyperscalers |
| **Datathons-as-a-Service** | Vetted ML community solves problems competitively | Production models in **weeks**, not quarters |

## I Stand For  
### 🛡️ Sovereign-by-Design Frameworks

> “As privacy becomes policy and compute becomes currency, sovereign-by-design AI is non-negotiable.”

The future of enterprise AI demands more than accuracy — it demands accountability.  

We’re designing systems that are:

- 🔐 **Privacy-first** – DPDP / GDPR / PDPL compliant from day zero  
- 📜 **Blockchain-auditable** – every inference has a trail  
- ⚡ **Compute-accessible** – decentralised GPUs, no vendor lock-in  
- 🌱 **Ethically scalable** – built and validated via real-world data challenges

If you're solving for trust, safety, or sovereignty — you're already on our wavelength.

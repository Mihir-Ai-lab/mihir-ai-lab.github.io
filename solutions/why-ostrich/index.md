### Why Ostrich AI Exists

Enterprise AI hits three walls:

- 📦 **Sensitive data** — privacy laws tighten daily  
- 🔐 **Valuable models** — IP must stay protected  
- 💸 **Expensive infra** — cloud GPU burn is real  

**Ostrich AI** = privacy-first, plug-and-play infra that meets BFSI, GovTech & HealthTech constraints on day one.

# Hi, I’m Mihir Thakkar

A systems-builder who’s spent over a decade converting chaos into clarity—digitizing operations, navigating compliance, and scaling workflows across industries.

Today, I’m building **Ostrich AI**, a platform designed to eliminate the real-world blockers to enterprise-grade AI:

- ✅ Secure data infrastructure  
- ✅ Scalable compute access  
- ✅ On-demand talent pipelines  

With our **patented dual-key, blockchain-based design**, we keep enterprise AI compliant, auditable, and IP-safe—without ballooning costs or complexity.

If you’re passionate about ethical AI infra, sovereign data systems, or deploying models in the wild—I’d love to connect.

## 🛡️ Sovereign by Design: What I Stand For

> _“As privacy becomes policy and compute becomes currency, the case for sovereign-by-design AI is undeniable.”_

I believe India can lead the world in deployable, consent-aware AI. That means:

- 🔐 Privacy-first infra (DPDP / GDPR-ready)  
- 🧾 Blockchain audit trails for every inference  
- 💻 Remote, democratized GPU access  
- 🌱 Ethical, scalable AI through real-world datathons

## 🧠 What We’re Building at Ostrich AI

A blockchain escrow between data owners and model creators:

1. **Data owner holds Key A** 🔑  
2. **Model owner holds Key B** 🔑  
3. **Blockchain logs every inference** 🔒  

✅ No silent leaks  
✅ Full auditability  
✅ Global compliance baked in

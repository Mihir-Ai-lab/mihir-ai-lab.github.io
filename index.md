## What I Actually Do

I architect systems that let enterprises ship ML **without leaking data, breaking laws, or torching budgets**.  
My toolkit: blockchain for auditability, decentralised GPUs for scale, and global talent for speed.

## GAFAI Delegate – Why It Matters

* **DPDP implementation** with patent-secured frameworks  
* **GPU Pradhan** – national compute-sharing for startups & researchers  
* India ⇄ EU ⇄ GCC regulatory bridges  
* 50 k+ devs up-skilled via ethical-AI datathons  

Because sovereign AI shouldn’t be a buzzword.

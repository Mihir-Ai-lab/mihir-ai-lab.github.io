A systems-builder who’s spent 12 years turning chaos into clarity—digitising ops, navigating compliance, and scaling workflows across industries.

Today I’m building **Ostrich AI** to delete the three blockers that stall enterprise ML:

✅ **Secure data** — privacy-first infra  
✅ **Scalable compute** — decentralised GPUs  
✅ **On-demand talent** — crowdsourced datathons  

Our **dual-key, blockchain escrow** keeps models compliant, auditable, and IP-safe—without ballooning cost or complexity.

If you care about sovereign data systems or shipping AI that actually works, let’s connect

### I Stand For&nbsp;🛡️ Sovereign by Design Frameworks

> “As privacy becomes policy and compute becomes currency, sovereign-by-design AI is non-negotiable.”

🔐 **Privacy-first infra** (DPDP / GDPR ready)  
📜 **Blockchain audit trails** for every inference  
⚡ **Democratised GPU access** without cloud sticker shock  
🌱 **Ethical scale** via real-world datathons

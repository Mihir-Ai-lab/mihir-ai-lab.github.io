## Hi – I’m Mihir

A **systems-builder** who’s spent more than a decade converting chaos into clarity—digitizing operations, navigating compliance, and scaling workflows across industries.

Today, I’m focused on removing the real-world blockers to enterprise AI: **secure data, scalable infrastructure, and on-demand talent**.

With our patented **dual-key, blockchain escrow** between data and algorithms (Patent #567234), we keep every deployment enterprise-grade, compliant, and IP-safe—**no GPU farms, no hiring army**.

If you’re passionate about AI infrastructure, enterprise MLOps, or just building systems that actually work—I’d love to connect.

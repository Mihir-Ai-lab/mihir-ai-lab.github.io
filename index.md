## Hi – I’m Mihir

A **systems-builder** who’s spent more than a decade converting chaos into clarity—digitising operations, untangling compliance knots, and scaling workflows across industries.

Today I’m focused on removing the three real-world blockers to enterprise AI: **secure data, elastic infrastructure, and ready talent**.

Our newly patented **dual-key blockchain escrow** lets data owners and algorithm owners collaborate without leaks, lock-in, or legal headaches (DPDP / GDPR / PDPL ready).

If you care about AI infra, MLOps, or simply building systems that actually work—let’s connect.

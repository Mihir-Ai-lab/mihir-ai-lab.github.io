A systems-builder who’s spent 12 years turning chaos into clarity—digitizing operations, navigating compliance, and scaling workflows across industries.

Now, I’m building **Ostrich AI** to eliminate the top blockers that stall enterprise ML:

✅ **Data privacy risks** — solved via dual-key blockchain escrow<br>
✅ **Expensive compute** — solved via decentralised GPU networks<br>
✅ **Talent gaps** — solved via global, on-demand datathons<br>

We’re not just promising enterprise-grade AI. We’re shipping it — compliant, scalable, and ready for the real world.

If you're building in AI, infra, or policy, I'm one message away.

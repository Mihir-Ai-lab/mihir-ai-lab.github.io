### “Ship models, not headaches.”

Enterprise AI usually stalls on one (or all) of three things:

1. **Data** is locked down  
2. **Compute** is expensive  
3. **Talent** is hard to scale

We delete those blockers with a **privacy-first, plug-and-play framework** that’s compliant out of the box and cost-efficient by design.
